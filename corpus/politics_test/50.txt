Obama offers condolences to Abe, blames terror group for 'brutal murder' of Japanese hostage
NEW DELHI (AP) â€” President Barack Obama has offered condolences to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe over the killing of a Japanese national by the Islamic State group.

The White House says Obama telephoned Abe from India. Obama arrived there Sunday morning for a three-day visit.

In an earlier statement, Obama condemned the "brutal murder" of Japanese citizen Haruna Yukawa. Obama's statement didn't say how the U.S. knew Yukawa was dead. The Japanese government is reviewing an online video that purports to show his death.

Obama says in the statement that the United States will stand "shoulder to shoulder" with Japan. The White House says he also conveyed that message to Abe during their conversation.

Obama also called for the immediate release of a second Japanese hostage being held by the militants.
