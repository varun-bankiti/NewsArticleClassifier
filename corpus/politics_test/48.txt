Obama: 'deeply concerned' about Ukraine violence, approach toward Russia won't change
NEW DELHI (AP) â€” President Barack Obama says his administration is "deeply concerned" about the latest deadly flare-up in eastern Ukraine, but he says he won't change how he's handling the situation.

Obama says he'll keep trying to isolate Russia and he will examine options short of military conflict with Russia.

Economic penalties against Russia by the U.S. and Europe have failed to curtail Russia's backing of rebels in eastern Ukraine.

Authorities say indiscriminate rocket fire on Saturday killed at least 30 people in Mariupol (mah-ROO'-pahl), in the southeast.

Russia says it's not backing the rebels. But Western military officials say the number of heavy weapons under rebel control tells a different story.

Obama commented in New Delhi during an appearance with Prime Minister Narendra Modi (nah-REN'-drah MOH'-dee).
