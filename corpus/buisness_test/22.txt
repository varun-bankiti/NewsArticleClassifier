Gujarat-based power generation company Adani Power  has reduced its consolidated net loss to Rs 369 crore in July-September quarter compared to Rs 799 crore in year-ago period, impacted by interest cost despite strong operational and revenue growth. Revenue increased 38.6 percent to Rs 5,751 crore from Rs 4,148 crore in same period due to increased number of power units sold. The company said it sold 15.10 billion units during the quarter, higher by 44 percent compared to 10.49 billion units in corresponding period of last fiscal. Numbers were far better than analysts' expectations. According to analysts polled by CNBC-TV18, loss was expected at Rs 438 crore and revenue of Rs 5,457 crore for the quarter with operating profit growth of 29 percent and margin contraction of 50 basis points. "Improvement in operational performance and focused efforts has contributed significantly to financial performance of the quarter," Vneet Jaain, chief executive officer said, adding recent impetus given by the government for increased domestic coal production is likely to improve financial performance in ensuing quarters. Consolidated operating profit (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) jumped 47.4 percent to Rs 1,791 crore and margin expanded by 180 basis points to 31.1 percent compared to same quarter last fiscal. EBIDTA impact of demerger of transmission business was more than compensated by lower cost and improved operational efficiencies achieved at all plants, Adani Power said. Interest expenses increased nearly 18 percent year-on-year to Rs Rs 1,605 crores due to one-time impact of Rs 98 crore towards prepayment penalty charges paid for refinancing of loans. It said refinancing of rupee loans would reduce interest cost going forward. Adani Power's board members have approved issue of equity shares on preferential basis to promoter and promoter group up to 39.81 crore equity shares.
