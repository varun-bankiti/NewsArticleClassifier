The apex court on Friday ruled against the government’s notification to levy custom duty on power generated from Mundra Port and Special Economic Zones (SEZ). The verdict also set aside a customs demand of Rs 300 crore against Adani Power  which came as huge relief to the company. In 2010, the government had issued a notification seeking to impose 16 percent customs duty on power generated in SEZs as it viewed the power sold from SEZ as an import. Adani Power had challenged the 2010 notification in the Gujarat High Court. The HC had quashed the notification as it held the levy of customs as ultra vires.
