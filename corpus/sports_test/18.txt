Dilip Vengsarkar, a prolific batsman during his playing days and a former India selector, has an eye for spotting talent; and according to him, Mumbai's Shreyas Iyer has all it takes to be the next poster boy of Indian batting.
With a double century and two centuries already in the ongoing Ranji Trophy season among his other prolific knocks, the Mumbai No. 3 seems to be in the fast lane to get an India cap, and Vengsarkar has absolutely no doubt about that.

"Shreyas is definitely ready for international cricket," Vengsarkar told dna. "Shreyas is not afraid of any attack. He is aggressive and plays positive cricket all the time...I feel he could be the match-winner India is looking for."
Mumbai's chief selector Milind Rege backed Vengsarkar's claims and even hinted that time is ripe to test Iyer in international cricket since he is at the top of his game at the moment.

"He needs to be given opportunity to test himself at the higher levels. It is fair considering this batsman has so many runs in the game," the Mumbaikar told dna before pointing at instances where Iyer has took on international bowlers in domestic circuit.
"He has scored against the likes of Praveen Kumar and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. He has hit Bhuvi twice over extra cover for sixes," Rege said.

However, Iyer hasn't been able to transform his domestic success in matches for India A and the warm-up fixture against the touring South African team. But Rege said it won't be fair to ignore his Ranji Trophy scores.
"The issue here is that the selectors haven't seen him scoring in Ranji Trophy. He is being judged on the runs he got against Steyn & Co in the warm-up game for Board President XI vs South Africa at the CCI and the India A performances."

Iyer got 9 for the Board President XI and played knocks of 38 and 49 and 49 against Bangladesh A and South Africa A, respectively.
Heaping praise on the batsman, Rege went on to add that there are not many who can match Iyer's batting talent.
"How many batsman do you see who can win a match on their own in India. I don't see anybody. Bowlers fear Shreyas. He is destructive. He is a special player we have got after a long time.
"The last batsmen we saw in Mumbai who bowlers were afraid of were Sachin Tendulkar and Vinod Kambli. Rohit Sharma is a class act, but this guy has got some unbelievable shots for every ball," Rege concluded.
