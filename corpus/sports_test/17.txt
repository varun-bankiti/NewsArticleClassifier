He improved 23 places on the second day.
Lahiri made use of a lot of chances that came his way despite the double on par-4 fifth. But after that mishap, he came back strongly with four birdies in five holes around the turn from seventh to 11th holes. He finished off the day with a birdie on 18th.

Lahiri is eight shots behind the leader, Andy Sullivan (66), whose 30-odd fellow members from his home club, Nuneaton, made for a noisy gallery while egging him onto some great play.
Already three-time winner this year, Sullivan shot an error-free 66 moving one ahead of Emiliano Grillo of Argentina. Grillo, like Lahiri features on the PGA Tour as a Rookie in 2015-16, but has already won once last month at Frys.com.
Today he shot a bogey-free 64, the best round of the day.
Early in his round, Lahiri made a couple of good pars and then after a stumble on the fifth, where his chip spun back and led to a double bogey, he played solid with six birdies over last 13 holes.
"Even yesterday there was no dent in confidence but it is nice to see results on the board, and I am happy to be in red figures again," said a relaxed Lahiri, who will also be getting a more experienced caddie, his friend, Neeraj, for the weekend.
Lahiri's regular caddie Rajiv Sharma was unable to make it because of visa problems and Lahiri played the first two rounds with a local golfer, Rohit Gupta.
Lahiri was all praise for him saying, "It's been a lot of fun. Obviously I miss having my regular caddie Rajiv on the bag -- that goes without saying. But having said that, I don't think I'm a very demanding guy on the course and Rohit has been fantastic.
"I got into my rhythm today and I played pretty good and could even have been a couple of shots better," he added.
"I had a shaky start, but made very good pars on third and fourth. Especially on the third, where I made an up-and-down from an unpleasant position."
Then Lahiri in his own words, "got hit by the golf course"
