Pakistan's seasoned off-spinner Saeed Ajmal has submitted a formal apology to the cricket board for some of his comments on a recent television show.
Ajmal, who has left for Bangladesh to play in the premier league, had his central contract suspended and was issued a show cause notice by PCB after the show on Geo Super channel.
Ajmal, who is sidelined from Pakistan team since last April, had criticised the board for not supporting his bid for a comeback to the national team and also for ignoring him after April.
The off-spinner also lashed out at the ICC for having double standards while enforcing the bowling action review by match officials through which his action was declared illegal last year and he was asked to modify his action.
A reliable source in the PCB said that Ajmal had conveyed to the board in writing that he regretted his remarks about the PCB in the interview and he never meant to undermine or deny their support for him all these years.
The source said that Ajmal had assured the board he would remain careful while appearing in the media and acknowledged the support and encouragement he had got from the board since his bowling action was reported and banned.
"He has also said that he was under a lot of pressure and stress because of his dispute with the university of agriculture in Faisalabad over the future of his academy there," the source added.
Even though Ajmal has not played for Pakistan since April, when he toured Bangladesh, the PCB awarded a category B central contract in July in lieu of his services to Pakistan cricket.
