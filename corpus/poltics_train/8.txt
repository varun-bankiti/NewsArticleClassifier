President Barack Obama says the downing of a Russian warplane by Turkey points to an "ongoing problem" with Russia's airstrikes in Syria.

Obama says Turkey "has a right to defend its territory and its airspace." And he says that Russia is operating very close to the Turkish border as it goes after moderate opposition groups that are supported by Turkey and a wide range of countries.

The president says that if Russia would instead concentrate its airstrikes on the Islamic State group, then mistakes would be "less likely to occur."

Obama is urging both Turkey and Russia to take measures "to discourage any kind of escalation" over the downing of the Russian warplane.

And Obama says that the downing of the plane underscores the importance of moving forward on efforts to find a political solution to the civil war in Syria.

President Barack Obama and French President Francois Hollande have started their Oval Office meeting on the global response to the Islamic State group.

Hollande arrived at the White House midmorning Tuesday. The two planned to take questions at a news conference following their meeting.

The sit-down comes less than two weeks after the Islamic State group launched a series of deadly attacks in Paris. The visit has been complicated by Turkey's shoot-down of a Russian warplane on Tuesday.

Hollande's trip to Washington is part of a diplomatic push to get the international community to bolster the campaign against the Islamic State. But he's likely to leave Washington without firm backing for his call to bring Russia into a new coalition to fight the extremists.
