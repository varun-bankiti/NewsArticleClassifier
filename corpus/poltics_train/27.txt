McCain gives thumbs up to 'American Sniper' movie, laments those disparaging film
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee says critics of U.S. foreign policy are disparaging the movie, "American Sniper" and denigrating the memory of Chris Kyle, the U.S. serviceman depicted in the film.

In a statement Monday, Sen. John McCain congratulated director Clint Eastwood and the cast and crew of the movie for honoring the life of Kyle whom he calls an American hero.

The Arizona Republican says the film offers a compassionate portrayal of service members, their wartime experiences, the burdens they often bear upon returning home and untold sacrifices of their families.

To critics like Michael Moore, a documentary maker, the film glorifies violence.

Moore, a staunch opponent of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, tweeted about the movie: "Snipers aren't heroes, and invaders are worse."
