Kerry Says Mideast Violence Could 'Spin Out of Control'
BOSTON (AP) — Secretary of State John Kerry says the violence between Israelis and Palestinians could "spin out of control" unless they take immediate steps to ease tensions.

Kerry — just back in the United States after visiting Israel and the West Bank for the first time in more than a year — says the U.S. is pressing both sides to show a "genuine commitment" to a two-state peace solution.

He tells reporters after landing in Boston on Wednesday that the situation is close to reaching "a pivotal point" after months of violent confrontations.
Kerry says the sides are facing "important decisions" and the U.S. hopes they make choices that will "advance the prospects for lasting peace."

On Tuesday, Kerry met separately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.
