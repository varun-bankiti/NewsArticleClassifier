Speaker Boehner acknowledges 'a couple of stumbles' in new Congress' opening weeks
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” House Speaker John Boehner (BAY'-nuhr) acknowledges that there've been "a couple of stumbles" in the opening weeks of the new Republican-run Congress.

Boehner says House Republicans wanted to get off to a fast start this year and so they moved bills quickly. Last week GOP leaders were forced to water down an abortion bill after criticism from Republican women and others, and this week leaders delayed action on a border security bill amid conservative opposition.

Boehner told reporters at news conference Tuesday that it's all part of Republicans' efforts "to assure the American people that we're here to listen to their priorities."

The way to deal with such issues, Boehner says, is for leadership to listen to rank-and-file lawmakers and work on their concerns.
