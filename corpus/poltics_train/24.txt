Sen. Harry Reid undergoes surgery to remove blood clot in eye, repair facial bones
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid underwent surgery Monday to remove a blood clot in his right eye and repair bones in his face, injuries from an accident he suffered while exercising more than three weeks ago.

A spokesman said the surgery was successful and doctors are optimistic that the 75-year-old Reid will regain vision in his injured eye, although they are not yet able to say if that will be the case.

Spokesman Adam Jentleson said Reid will recuperate at his home in Washington this week.

Jentleson said that in addition to repairing bones in Reid's right brow, temple and cheek and removing a blood clot in his right eye, doctors removed additional blood from the front of the eye.
