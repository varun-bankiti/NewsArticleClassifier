House GOP sidetracks border security bill opposed by White House and some conservatives
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” House Republicans have sidetracked legislation to secure the U.S.-Mexican border that is drawing opposition from some conservatives who say it does too little to stem illegal immigration.

A spokesman says the decision was made to remove the bill from the weekly schedule because bad weather in the Northeast and an end-of-week Democratic retreat mean there won't be enough time to consider it.

In addition to opposition from some conservatives, Democrats and the Obama administration also oppose the measure as misguided, and it isn't clear it has enough votes to pass.

It is not clear when it might come to a vote.

The bill would require operational control of high-traffic border areas within two years, and of the full border within five years.
