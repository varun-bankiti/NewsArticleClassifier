Tata Motors  chairman Cyrus Mistry has aggressive scripted the turnaround plan for its passenger vehicle (PV) business, reports CNBC-TV18's Ronojoy Banerjee. The company is expected to adopt a new PV strategy to boost sales. The plan, cleared by a Mistry-headed committee, is to stop the commercial use of new passenger cars. Infact, the company is asking dealers to push the Kite- the PV that will be launched next month- as a vehicle only for personal use. Sources say the company may phase out the existing vehicles with new launches and has aggressive launch plans too. By 2019 the company is hoping to launch five new vehicles by 2019 and a new sedan named 'Kite 5' in 2016.  The company will launch new special utility vehicles (SUV) named 'Eagle' and 'X104' in 2016, 17 and premium SUV codenames 'X601' in 2018.
