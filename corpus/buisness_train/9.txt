 Two-wheeler maker TVS Motor Company is looking to improve its market share in the 100-125cc bike segments in the current fiscal.

The industry considers bikes in the 100-125cc segments as used mostly for travel from home to work and hence, has tagged them as the commuter segment.

“The commuter segment constitutes a large part of the sales in the two-wheeler market. At present, we have a market share of 6 per cent in the segment and we want to increase it to 8 per cent,” said J.S. Srinivasn, vice-president (sales) of TVS Motor Company.


Major bike makers such as Hero, Honda and Bajaj all have models in the segment.

Srinivasn said the company was banking on its new motorcycle Star City plus and existing Sport to drive sales as it gears up to increase sales in the segment by 10,000 units. At present, TVS sells around 33,000 units in the commuter segment compared with the industry size of 5.95 lakh units per month.
