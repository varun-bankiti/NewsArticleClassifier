Obama raising campaign cash in Illinois for home state Gov. Pat Quinn.
CHICAGO (AP) â€” President Barack Obama is helping raise campaign cash in the home stretch for Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn.

Obama is in Chicago headlining a high-dollar fundraiser at the home of Meredith Bluhm Wolf, sister of philanthropist Leslie Bluhm. The Quinn campaign says about 25 people are attending the $50,000-per-person event.

The event comes while Obama is in the area to deliver an economic address at Northwestern University.

Obama's fundraiser for Quinn is closed to reporters.

Quinn is in a tight contest for a second term against Republican businessman Bruce Rauner (ROW'-nur).

First lady Michelle Obama is scheduled to be in Chicago Tuesday to help with Quinn's campaign. She's recorded a radio ad saying she and the president will be voting for their friend.
